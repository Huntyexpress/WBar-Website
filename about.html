        <h1>MEET DR. PAYTON SCHIEFFER</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was raised out on W Bar Ranch, just north of Wibaux, with my 4
          sisters and parents. I played college basketball and volleyball in
          North Dakota, when an injury took me in the direction of chiropractic.
          I then decided to attend chiropractic school at Northwestern Health
          Sciences University and graduated in November 2020.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I knew at the start of chiropractic school, I wanted to help the
          animal population as well. I received my Animal Chiropractic
          Certification from Parker University in Dallas, TX in August 2020.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am here to help the Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota
          population anyway I can! Don’t hesitate to reach out with any question
          you may have!

        <h1>WHAT I DO IN MY FREE TIME!</h1>

        <p>
          I love spending time with my family and friends. I also try to help
          out at the ranch whenever I can! Having been in different locations
          for school the passed 8 years, I have really grown to appreciate
          Eastern, MT and the small town living! Some hobbies I have learned to
          love are Crossfit, trying out new breweries, traveling and hanging out
          with my dogs (Lynyrd & Hank)!
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently working to update my late grandma Irma’s house, to make
          that my new home out on the ranch! The crocuses that are on the
          horseshoe in my logo, were chosen because they were my grandmas
          favorite flowers!
