"<div class='slide'><h2 class='' style='max-width: 100%;'>'HIGHLY recommend Payton. Not only is she personable and professional, you can tell she really cares about her patients. She got me in quickly after an incident and fixed me right up. It wasnâ€™t just the treatment, though. Payton gave me specific instructions and parameters to follow and didnâ€™t make me feel fearful of movement. In fact, as an athlete herself, she encouraged movement. Sheâ€™s so smart and has lots of tools and treatments available and I am so grateful to have her around. Sheâ€™s going to help me keep moving well for years and years to come.'</h2><div class='' style='margin-top: 1%; max-width: 100%;'> <p class='' style='white-space:pre-wrap;'> -S.

"<div class='slide'><h2 class='' style='max-width: 100%;'>'I went to Payton in a lot of pain from what turned out to be a rib out of place. I had also recently had minor surgery. She was extremely careful, used heat to make sure I was completely relaxed when we started, and adjusted me very gently yet very thoroughly. She also gave me detailed instructions for how to best deal with several days of travel immediately following the visit.  Thanks to her, I was able to enjoy the next several days of activities rather than be miserable. Payton has a blend of professional knowledge and skill and a great personality to make you feel comfortable. I would recommend W Bar Chiropractic to anyone.'</h2><div class='' style='margin-top: 1%; max-width: 100%;'><p class='' style='white-space:pre-wrap;'> -A.Stenson</p></div></div>"]
